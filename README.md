### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Ben Sehic, a software engineer with a passion for building web applications using modern technologies.

I have extensive experience working with TypeScript, I also specialize in Angular, these frameworks and languages help me build complex, scalable applications with ease.

I'm skilled in deploying applications to the cloud using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Whether it's setting up infrastructure, configuring load balancers, or managing data stores, I'm comfortable with a wide range of AWS services.

I'm learning React with Next.js and using SST (Serverless Stack) by building a personal project which contains a variety of different gym resources as well as the ability to log your workouts.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on new challenges, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a project or discussing potential opportunities! ðŸš€
